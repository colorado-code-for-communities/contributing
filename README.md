#How to Help?

You're passionate about helping others, and you're interested in using technology to do it. Great! So are we!
And we can definitely use your skills. 

###If you're a community organizer

###If you're a developer

###If you *want* to be a developer

###If you're a designer

###If you *want* to be a designer

###If you have a great idea
We need great project ideas in order to build the applications to help others! If you have a great idea but
aren't  sure how to implement it, come to any of our meetings or leave a message in our 
[google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/colorado-code-for-communities). 

A few things to do that would make your project proposal even better:
* Look for the data needed to make this project work. It would be great to build a live bus tracker, but 
we can't do anything if the data doesn't exist. If you could find the data, link to it, even 
[clean it up](https://code.google.com/p/google-refine/) (if you can!) before presenting your idea, the
developers and designers have a better chance of tackling your idea. If you're not sure how to collect
the data, leave a message in the 
[google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/colorado-code-for-communities) and 
ask.
* Think small at first. If you have a big idea, think of the small steps you have to take before
