#How to Help?

You're passionate about helping others, and you're interested in using technology to do it. Great! So are we!
And we can definitely use your skills. 

###If you're a community organizer

###If you're a developer
We're always looking for developers of all levels to start new projects or contribute to existing ones. Some of the
types of projects we've been tackling are data cleanup and collection, bike route creation, intuitive APIs, 
data visualization, and a lot more.

###If you *want* to be a developer
Here's a great list of beginner code resources:
* [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com)

Once you think you have the fundamentals, try building a [Scraper](https://scraperwiki.com/)! Look for data 
locked in HTML, XML, CSV, etc format and write a script to import the data to a database.

###If you're a designer
We need to make our apps easy to use for everyone. We need data to tell a story or make a point without 
any obfuscation.

###If you *want* to be a designer

###If you have a great idea
We need great project ideas in order to build the applications to help others! If you have a great idea but
aren't  sure how to implement it, come to any of our meetings or leave a message in our 
[google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/colorado-code-for-communities). 

A few things to do that would make your project proposal even better:
* Look for the data needed to make this project work. It would be great to build a live bus tracker, but 
we can't do anything if the data doesn't exist. If you could find the data, link to it, even 
[clean it up](https://code.google.com/p/google-refine/) (if you can!) before presenting your idea, the
developers and designers have a better chance of tackling your idea. If you're not sure how to collect
the data, leave a message in the 
[google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/colorado-code-for-communities) and 
ask.
* Think small at first. If you have a big idea, think of the small steps you, the developers, the designers,
and government memebers have to take to make this project a reality and write them down.
